                                    I really like Jordan since the first time I saw his clips from the lectures he gives that are mainly about sociology and psychology that build you up motivationally. But also he is a very comprehensive author that he can back his ideas with his financial and academic suggestions. In the interview, he speaks mainly of entrepreneurs and economical management on different jobs with his definition of success.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Defining success in different domains across the lifespan requires proper categories. For example, categorizing jobs turn out to be quite difficult without the simplest conceptual scheme. It is like two by two matrix where there are simple and complex jobs. For simple jobs, once you are trained you have to repeat what you are doing such as working in a factory line or restocking grocery shelves. And the best predictor for success in this job category is conscientiousness, not IQ. In other words, taking the job seriously as a result of feeling guilty-disgusted and useless.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For complex jobs where the demands change on a regular basis it is not possible to learn the job once and for all. Managerial/Administrative positions turn out to be more conservative and require more IQ over conscientiousness as a predictor percentage. Other than these two job categories there are entrepreneurs against managerial/administrative workers. The best predictors for entrepreneurial success are IQ and trade openness. These two predictors set entrepreneurs as artists on the creativity dimension and political liberals on trade openness. This means if you are an entrepreneur you are going to be a lateral thinker which allows you to trigger a whole bunch of different ideas once you hear an idea.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    However, your downfall will be organizational abilities. So it is often useful for entrepreneurial types to pair themselves with managerial and administrative types in order to balance the tension between doing one thing right and scanning the landscape for something new to do that would be worthwhile. As the company gets more and more established the managerial and administrative types tend to dominate which becomes problematic for all big companies because it means it is a lot more difficult for the company to shift laterally when it has to.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The fundamental problem is most new ideas are dangerous, disruptive, and often counterproductive. There is a subset of new ideas that are absolutely necessary and they are the thing you need to do next which is a very difficult innovational thing to solve. Another big mistake that new companies do is emphasize the development of the company without forcing their entrepreneurs to find new customers.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As a business person, finding the first customer, someone who will actually pay you that first time, is the most difficult thing you will ever gain. Two main ways people decide whether they are going to buy something are knowing anyone else who is already bought it or if there is other people in their domain that are already using it.
                                </p>

                                    Overall it is essential to interact with the right person. If you think your sales pitch is new and revolutionary you better be talking to someone who is entrepreneurial, risk-taking, and interested in revolutionary ideas instead of the middle manager in a company because the last thing that person wants is putting his job and reputation on the line for your product even if it is revolutionary.
