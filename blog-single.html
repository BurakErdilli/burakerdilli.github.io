                                    Every year, Samsung spends untold amounts of money on ad campaigns more concerned with bashing Apple’s iPhone than promoting its Galaxy phones. But Apple has been selling the iPhone for a decade now, and that’s hardly prevented Samsung from selling tens of millions of phones every year. It’s Chinese Android manufacturers like Huawei, Xiaomi, and OnePlus that have emerged as genuine threats to mobile market sales around the world. Oppo is high on the list of serious rivals of the top brands in the market, and it has made its biggest push outside of China with the unique Find X back in 2018.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Recently OPPO released their brand new flagship smartphone OPPO FIND X 2. Almost two years ago during the time, the first model of the FIND X series came out, it changed the perspective and expectations of the smartphone market majority. So this review will be focussing on the origin of the FIND X series.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What it did was the first mechanical implementation that provides an extreme screen-to-body ratio (which is astonishing 93.8% according to OPPO). The competition of the revolutionary screen designs first occurred during the release of the iPhone X back on November 3rd, 2017. After the release, every major brand such as Asus, Xiaomi, LG, Huawei, Motorola, General Mobile, Samsung was trying to get rid of or at least shorten the thick black bars on the top and bottom of the screen in order to create a clear a more UI friendly designs.
                                </p>

                                    <p class="mb-0">“Dare to be different.”</p>
                                </blockquote>
                                <p>
                                    However, they were not able to completely accomplish that task as a result of the selfie camera and sensors’ position in the front. The best they could do was to stick everything that will be on the screen side to a notch(as small as possible) on the top. And we have seen plenty of similar designs following that year.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What OPPO FIND X started was the ability to hide everything recently placed inside a notch by collecting them into one platform which is mechanically moving up and down when the function is needed and they also used that platform as a design element. Obviously, that seemed like a vulnerable feature at the beginning due to being a representation of a new concept of design. Some of the other questions were about how the protective cases are going to be, how durable is the motorized platform.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    On top of the enterprising design attempt, OPPO did not reveal this device with any lack of hardware inside. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 (which was the top of the class in 2018), 8GB of RAM comes with 256GB of storage, a 3730mAh battery, dual SIM tray, VOOC Fast Charge, 20MP+16MP dual camera on the back, and 25MP Front Camera. It is critical to realize that the fast charging technology used in this device was an origin of a new competition category on charging speed. And a more developed version of fast charging will be seen on OPPO FIND X 2.
